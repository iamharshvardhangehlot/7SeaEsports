                    information. This access information includes, among others, the purposes of the processing, the
                    categories of personal information concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom
                    the personal information has been or will be disclosed. However, this is not an absolute right, and
                    the interests of other individuals may restrict your right to access. For your protection, we may
                    only implement requests with respect to the personal information associated with the particular
                    email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before
                    implementing your request.

                    You have the right to request that we delete personal information about you in certain
                    circumstances, and we may be required to do so. Please note that we may need to retain certain
                    information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to
                    requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be
                    able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such a
                    purchase or promotion).



                    <h4>Under certain circumstances:</h4>

                    You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information. If so, the
                    applicable personal information will be marked and may only be processed by us for certain purposes.
                    You have the right to ask us to provide you with your personal information in a structured, commonly
                    used, and machine-readable format, and you have the right to transmit that data to another entity
                    without hindrance from us.
                    You can object on grounds relating to your particular situation at any time to the processing of
                    your personal information by us and require us to stop processing your personal information. The
                    right to object may especially apply if we collect and process your personal information for
                    profiling purposes in order to better understand your interests in our products and services or for
                    direct marketing. If you have a right to object and you exercise this right, we will no longer
                    process your personal information for those purposes. You may exercise this right by contacting us.
                    The right to object may, in particular, not exist if the processing of your personal information is
                    necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already
                    concluded.
